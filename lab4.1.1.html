<!-- Reflection Questions 

1. I learned alot this module and was pretty lost. That said now Ive learned different ways of assigned parameters in the many ways Javascript allows you to.
With let and const function. Inside and outside the function.

2. Using the live server it seems if one thing is wrong will throw a syntax error. Very frustrating at the start but once I understood how to set up a function
properly it got alot easier. 

3. Refactoring improves readability by creating a flow of easy to read and understand code.  -->
